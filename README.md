# Deep-Learning-Challenge

**Overview of Analysis:** The purpose of this analysis is to build a machine learning model to help a company select funding applciants that are most likely to be successful in their endeavors.

**Results:**
* What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? The 'Is_Successful' column is the target (what we're looking to predict)
* What variable(s) are the features for your model? The features of this model are: 'Application_Type', 'Affiliation', 'Classification', 'Use_Case', 'Organization', 'Status', 'Income_Amount', 'Special_Considerations', and 'Ask_Amt'
*What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? We removed the 'Ein' and 'Name' variables

**Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
